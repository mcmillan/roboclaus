Hello, Roboclaus here.
<br /><br />
Good news â€“ we've matched you up with someone for <%= @group.name %>'s secret santa.
<br /><br />
The person you're sending a present to is <strong><%= @recipient.name %></strong>.
<br /><br />
Their address is:
<%= simple_format(@recipient.address) %>

You need to make sure that they receive their gift before <strong><%= @group.deadline.strftime('%d %B %Y') %></strong> (that's <%= distance_of_time_in_words(@group.deadline, DateTime.now) %> from now). Please don't spend more than <strong><%= @group.budget %></strong> on their gift.
<%- if ENV['ANONYMOUS_MESSAGING_ENABLED'] %>
<br /><br />
If you're not sure what to get your match, or if you need to ask them a question (like if they have any dietary requirements, or a long-term phobia of bees), just reply to this email and I'll forward your message to <%= @recipient.name %>.
<% end %>
<br /><br />
See you soon!
<br /><br />
Roboclaus
