Hello, Roboclaus here.

Good news â€“ we've matched you up with someone for <%= @group.name %>'s secret santa.

The person you're sending a present to is <%= @recipient.name %>.

Their address is:
<%= @recipient.address %>

You need to make sure that they receive their gift before <%= @group.deadline.strftime('%d %B %Y') %> (that's <%= distance_of_time_in_words(@group.deadline, DateTime.now) %> from now). Please don't spend more than <%= @group.budget %> on their gift.

If you're not sure what to get your match, or if you need to ask them a question (like if they have any dietary requirements, or a long-term phobia of bees), just reply to this email and I'll forward your message to <%= @recipient.name %>.

See you soon!

Roboclaus
